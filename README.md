# QuizApp

This is a general knowledge quiz that, in my opinion, could be used as a battle round in a competition between primary school students.

The project was part of the Android Basics Nanodegree created by Udacity, in collaboration with Google, User Interface Chapter.

In making the project, I used nested view groups, radio button, checkbox, edit text, a method to hide the keyboard when not in use, a method to go back to the top of the screen, onSaveInstanceState method.
